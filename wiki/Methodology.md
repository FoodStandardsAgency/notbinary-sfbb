Notbinary run Discoveries with a pragmatic rather than dogmatic approach - with a strong focus on co-design with the client team members.

We use a lightweight lean/agile approach which focuses on a rapid cycle of sprint-planning and delivery activities (including daily stand-up meetings and regular showcase activities) but postpones other agile ceremonies (like the Retrospectives) until after delivery of the final outcomes. This ensures work is delivered both quickly and incrementally, enabling us to demonstrate real progress and capture early feedback. 

Our method is strongly influenced by the approach Will Myddelton wrote about here: http://www.myddelton.co.uk/blog/three-ways-to-run-better-discoveries and also the way Sarah Prag tackles things https://makeitquotidian.co.uk/2015/06/16/discovering-discovery/ but is flexible enough to react to the context on the ground. Our methodology provides a framework that our teams iterate based on what works best for the problem at hand.

The Goals are assigned to individual Discovery team members. (Whilst Discovery is a Team Sport, it helps to give individuals responsibility for ensuring delivery.) The Goals are loosely divided amongst the team in line with the Discovery Blocks diagram:

A recent addition to our ways of working is a commitment to following the advice from this guidance published by Doteveryone about writing better final 'reports' - https://doteveryone.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Doteveryone-definition-of-done-.pdf
