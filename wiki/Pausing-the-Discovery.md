Due to disruption and sensitivities (particularly with FBOs) caused by the COVID-19, the discovery was paused on 24th March 2020. 

Although consistency of the individual Notbinary team members (at the time of the pause) cannot be ensured to complete the discovery, we would **strongly advise** keeping Alison Saunders as part of the delivery team once the discovery re-starts.

A full set of team workings and outputs are on the [discovery drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1ctKss0JgZjwz8wOphRuPT_oW1A0ThajG)

Outstanding work is on the team [Trello](https://trello.com/b/D71sSLIN/fsa-sfbb-discovery)

At the time of the pause, FBOs have not been contacted. The full targeted list of those users and stakeholders to be interviewed is presented on the interview schedule. Local authorities highlighted in purple highlight those LAs that have been identified as likely to nominate FBOs for the FSA to contact. To date, Luton has provided FBO names, Doncaster has agreed to do so in principle.
