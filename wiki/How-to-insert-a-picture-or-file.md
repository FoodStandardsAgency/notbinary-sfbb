## Introduction

This guide steps through the sequence of actions needed to add an image or other file to this wiki.

## Guidelines

Images and downloads are all stored in a single folder called "Assets". Please give your upload a meaningful name:

 * use a `lowercase-with-dashes.jpg` style name
 * make sure the name describes the content of the file

## Uploading

The following steps allow you to upload images and files to Github:

 * Navigate to the [uploads folder](https://github.com/notbinary/fsa-incidents-disco/tree/master/Assets)
 * Click the **Upload files** button (this is to the top-right of the file listing at the time of writing)
 * Select the file you want to add
 * Scroll to the bottom of the page and (optionally) enter a comment and description for this upload
 * Click the green **Commit changes** button
 * Github will process the upload
 * Confirm the uploads folder file list now contains your upload. 

NB at the time of writing, after uploading a file, Github takes you to the top level. You may need to navigate back into the Assets folder to see your upload.

## Linking

You'll need a different link and format for an image than you will for a file. Make sure use the example in the right section below. 

The following steps allow you to link to an **image** you have uploaded:

 * Navigate to [the wiki](https://github.com/notbinary/fsa-incidents-disco/wiki) and find the page you want the image to appear in
 * Edit the page and use the following format to link to the image: `[[https://github.com/notbinary/fsa-incidents-disco/blob/master/Assets/my-uploaded-image.jpg|alt=Alternative text for accessibility]]`

The following steps allow you to link to a **file** you have uploaded:

 * Navigate to [the wiki](https://github.com/notbinary/fsa-incidents-disco/wiki) and find the page you want the image to appear in
 * Edit the page and use the link format to refer to the file: `[descriptive link text](https://github.com/notbinary/fsa-incidents-disco/raw/master/Assets/my-uploaded-file.pdf)`

You can access the [official Github documentation](https://help.github.com/en/articles/editing-wiki-content#adding-images) for more detail.

## Deleting

If you need to delete a file (for example if it's uploaded with the wrong name or to the wrong folder) you can use the following steps:

 * Click on the filename in the folder listing
 * This takes you to a screen showing the details of the image or file
 * To the top right of the file there should be a dustbin icon
 * Click this, then scroll to the bottom of the page and click **Commit changes**
 * Confirm the file has been deleted
