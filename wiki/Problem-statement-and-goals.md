The FSA provide information on food safety management procedures and food hygiene regulations for small businesses.

Last year, the service had nearly 800K visitors but it continues to serve the vast majority of its information through pdfs. 

There is acknowledgement in the FSA that the existing service is not fit for purpose. 

## Goals

The primary goal of the discovery is to determine how the service is currently performing and the experience it is providing for your users.
