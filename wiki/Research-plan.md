We created a plan to help plan and support the research throughout the Discovery process. Specifically, the plan:

* Provides the requirements for each interview
* Ensures consistency  
* Ensures we are considering all angles

**Note** - this is a live document at the time of the discovery being paused. It should therefore be used to help shape and inform the remaining user research prior to the discovery being completed.
